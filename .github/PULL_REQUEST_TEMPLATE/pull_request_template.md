We thank you for helping improve Crystal. In order to ease the reviewing process, we ask you to consider the following points before submitting a PR:

1. We prefer to discuss the underlying issue _prior_ to discussing the code. Therefore, we kindly ask you to refer an existing issue, or an existing discussion in a public space with members of the Core Team (forum, Gitter, Discord, ...). In few cases we acknowledge that this might not be necessary, for instance when refactoring code or small bug-fixes. In this case the PR must include the same information an issue would have: an clear explanation of the issue, reproducible code, etc.

2. Focus the PR to the referred issue, and restraint from adding unrelated changes/additions. We do welcome another PR if you fixed another issue.

3. If your change is big, consider breaking it in several smaller PRs. The smaller the change, the quicker we can review it.
